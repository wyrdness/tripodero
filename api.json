      "full": "The Tripodero is a fearsome critter from American lumberjack folklore, distinguished by its three legs (hence the name) and unusual hunting method. The creature stands on its tripod-like legs near clay banks, using its hollow, telescopic snout as a blowgun to shoot clay pellets at prey. The compressed air propulsion stuns victims, which the Tripodero then eats. Associated with southwestern regions and clay bank habitats, it represents the creative absurdity of fearsome critter tradition - an impossible creature with an ridiculous hunting mechanism."
